== FEATURES == 
support CONNECT (done)
support subscription/send (done)

async subscription/send
support DISCONNECT
server startup script
acceptance tests
increase test coverage with some kind of mock

== DEFECTS ==
subscriptions should not be recorded in DETS
currently I only support "\n" as newline, not "\r\n"
I use {packet, raw} in gen_tcp:listen, so it doesn't support telnet access
I use c:memory(total) as seed to create random session id
debug text outputs need to be cleard

== FUTURE ==
full protocol support
create an application (shall we?)
implement Stomp with gen_fsm

current version: 0.0.2


== FEATURES == 
support transaction (done)

async subscription/send: what should the broker do if nowhere to SEND or doesn't get ACK?
support ACK


== HOUSECLEAN ==
fully automate acceptance tests / continuous integration
increase test coverage with some kind of mock


== DEFECTS ==
transaction is not atomic: subscribers are not guaranteed receiving all-or-not
currently I only support "\n" as newline, not "\r\n"
I use {packet, raw} in gen_tcp:listen, so it doesn't support telnet access
I use c:memory(total) as seed to create random session id
send receipt for CONNECT if the client asks for it


== FUTURE ==
compatibility test fixture
full protocol support: ERROR (anything else?)
create an application (shall we?)
implement Stomp with gen_fsm

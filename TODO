== FEATURES == 
support CONNECT (done)
support DISCONNECT
server startup script
support subscription/send

== DEFECTS ==
currently I only support "\n" as newline, not "\r\n"
I use {packet, raw} in gen_tcp:listen, so it doesn't support telnet access
I use c:memory(total) as seed to create random session id

== FUTURE ==
full protocol support
implement Stomp with gen_fsm

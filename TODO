current version: 0.0.2


== FEATURES == 
support transaction (done)

support ERROR


== HOUSECLEAN ==
create stub for socket (done)

add tests for tcp_stomp with stubbed socket
fully automate acceptance tests / continuous integration


== DEFECTS ==
transaction is not atomic: subscribers are not guaranteed receiving all-or-not
currently I only support "\n" as newline, not "\r\n"
I use {packet, raw} in gen_tcp:listen, so it doesn't support telnet access
I use c:memory(total) as seed to create random session id
send receipt for CONNECT if the client asks for it


== FUTURE ==
queue subscription/send
support ACK
compatibility test fixture
full protocol support: what's left?
create an application (shall we?)
implement Stomp with gen_fsm

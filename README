my environment:
	- Cygwin
	- Erlang/OTP R11B-5
	- EUnit 2.0 Beta
	- Java 6
	- Ant 1.7.0
	- Perl 5.8.8

to make it run:
	make startup 	# console 1, should start an Erlang console
	make test 		# console 2, should pass all tests and kill the Erlang process in console 1
	
NOTE: 
Destinations could be both topics(sender/subscriber) or queues(producer/consumer).
By default they are all topics.
To create a queue, just name it starting with "queue^".
(E.g. "/a/b" would be a topic, and "queue^/a/b" would be a queue.)
